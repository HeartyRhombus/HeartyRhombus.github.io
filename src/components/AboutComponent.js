        I am currently enjoying my first tech role and am a 2021 graduate of
        Flatiron School's Full Time Online Software Engineering Program. Prior
        to entering the tech space, my background included retail and customer
        service within the travel and home improvement industries.
        <br />I love learning new things, and when I'm not coding I like to
        spend time in my garden, baking, woodworking, restoring classic cars, or
        with my family and friends!
